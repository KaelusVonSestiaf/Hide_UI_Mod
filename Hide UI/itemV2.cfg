title = "Hide UI";
description = "This mod adds a keybind that allows you to quickly toggle the UI on or off.
Comes with three modes:
-[b][u]Partial[/u][/b] will allow you turn off most of the UI, but keeps some prompts, subtitles and twitch mode votes. Acts exactly like the Act on Instinct mutator. Better suited for normal gameplay.
-[b][u]Complete[/u][/b] will turn the UI off completely, best suited for screenshots.
-[b][u]Camera[/u][/b] is the same as Complete, but it will also hide the first person arms and weapon. Best suited for taking screenshots of the scenery.

NEW: Also has a checkbox you can toggle to tell the mod that you want to keep the outline system turned on even while my mod is hiding the UI.

This is my first mod! Please let me know if you find any issues.

Special thanks to all these patient, lovely people that helped me make this!
