description = "You know how some of Kerillian's hats look awful because they remove her hood for no reason? Well, I think that's terrible, so I made a mod.
[b]This mod adds a toggleable UI window that lets you change how an equipped hat affects your character's model.[/b]
Generally this will look terrible, but if you look for it you can use it to good results by making things like lifting Kerillian's hood when one of her masks lowers it and make it look good.

As a bonus, those using the mod [b]'More Hats and Frames'[/b] (which lets you equip hats from another class or character), you'll know normally this can end up looking really bad if the default way in which the skin tries to interact with this hat looks bad. The mod can circumvent that by letting you try out different settings that can make the incompatible hat actually work.

Feedback welcome!
I also have no idea if other players can see the changes, lemme know if they do.";
